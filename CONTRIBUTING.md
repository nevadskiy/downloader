# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests.

## Pull Requests

- **Add tests** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the [README.md](README.md) and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
